CSS evolves rapidly, and it can be difficult to stay on top of the most recent modules, features, and best practices. In this course, Morten Rand-Hendriksen aims to fill this gap by riding the bleeding edge of CSS to showcase what’s new, what’s possible, and how to use cutting edge CSS in a safe way in production. To do this, Morten uses one of the least-cutting edge methods possible, paper. But by cutting away as much distraction as possible, Morten helps you visualize how CSS code relates to the actual browser output, which is key to mastering CSS.
